1. Ask for Height.
2.    If height is less than 1 or bigger than 8, ask again.
3.    If not, assign height to a variable, simply n.
4. Create a loop which will iterate n times. (Create a variable i and iterate i by n number of times since n is our height).
5.    Create a nested loop which will prints #'s equal to i on each iteration. (First Iteration = #, Second Iteration = ##, Etc.).
6.    Print a new line after each iteration.
