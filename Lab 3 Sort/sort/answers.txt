sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?:
Bubble sort, outperforms the other 2 sorting algorithms in a sorted array. Also, it has the same running time with another sorting algorithm which are both
much higher than the remaining one. Last but not least, the running time between sorted and reversed lists has a significant difference.

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?:
It has a higher running time in a sorted list than the bubble sort but lower than the selection sort. Its running time between sorted, reversed and
random lists are nearly the same. Also, it has the lowest running time on the random list by far.

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?:
It has nearly similar running time between sorted, reversed and random lists. However, they are much higher than the merge sort.
